<h2> Why Use The Command-Line </h2>
<p> Have you ever noticed in the movies when the “super hacker” — you know,
the guy who can break into the ultra - secure military computer in under 30
seconds — sits down at the computer, he never touches a mouse? It’s because
movie makers realize that we, as human beings, instinctively know the only
way to really get anything done on a computer is by typing on a keyboard.</p>

<h2> What This Book Is About </h2>
          <p> This is not a book about Linux system administration. While any serious
discussion of the command line will invariably lead to system administration
topics, this book touches on only a few administration issues. It will, how-
ever, prepare the reader for additional study by providing a solid founda-
tion in the use of the command line, an essential tool for any serious system
administration task.</p></section>

              <h2> What Is The Shell? </h2>
<p> When we speak of the command line, we are really
referring to the shell. The shell is a program that takes
keyboard commands and passes them to the operating
system to carry out. Almost all Linux distributions sup-
ply a shell program from the GNU Project called bash .
The name bash is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell, a
reference to the fact that bash is an enhanced replace-
ment for sh , the original Unix shell program written
by Steve Bourne.</p>
