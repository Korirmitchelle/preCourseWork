                <h2> Why Use The Command-Line </h2>
                <p> Have you ever noticed in the movies when the “super hacker” — you know, the guy who can break into the ultra - secure military computer in under 30 seconds — sits down at the computer, he never touches a mouse? It’s because movie makers realize that we, as human beings, instinctively know the only way to really get anything done on a computer is by typing on a keyboard.</p>

                <h2> What This Book Is About </h2>
                <p> This is not a book about Linux system administration. While any serious discussion of the command line will invariably lead to system administration topics, this book touches on only a few administration issues. It will, how- ever, prepare the reader for additional study by providing a solid founda- tion in the use of the command line, an essential tool for any serious system administration task.</p>

            <h2> What Is The Shell? </h2>
            <p> When we speak of the command line, we are really referring to the shell. The shell is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the operating system to carry out. Almost all Linux distributions sup- ply a shell program from the GNU Project called bash . The name bash is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell, a reference to the fact that bash is an enhanced replace- ment for sh , the original Unix shell program written by Steve Bourne.</p>
